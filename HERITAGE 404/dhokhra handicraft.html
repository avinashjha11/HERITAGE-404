        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p id="1"><h3>The Bastar region, a district in Chhattisgar, is home to tribes who specialise in Dhokra handicraft. It’s wax casting technique has been in India for more than 4,000 years. One of the earliest known dhokra artifacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro. These products are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. But, again, very few tribes are practicing the art and no one has been able to come up with a technology to save the 250-year-old legacy.<a href="- https://www.indiatimes.com/culture/who-we-are/9-indian-art-forms-that-could-disappear-forever-if-they-re-not-saved-250533.html">Source</a></h3>
        <h3>Dhokra (also spelt Dokra) is non–ferrous metal casting using the lost-wax casting technique. This sort of metal casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost wax artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro.The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated.The lost wax technique for casting of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America, and other places.</h3>

        <h2>The process</h2>

        <p id="2"><h3>
            There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is predominant in the south of India the latter is more common in Central and Eastern India. Solid casting does not use a clay core but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.
The first task in the lost wax hollow casting process consists of developing a clay core which is roughly the shape of the final cast image. Next, the clay core is covered by a layer of wax composed of pure beeswax, resin from the tree Damara orientalis, and nut oil. The wax is then shaped and carved in all its finer details of design and decorations. It is then covered with layers of clay, which takes the negative form of the wax on the inside, thus becoming a mould for the metal that will be poured inside it. Drain ducts are left for the wax, which melts away when the clay is cooked. The wax is then replaced by the molten metal, often using brass scrap as basic raw material. The liquid metal poured in hardens between the core and the inner surface of the mould. The metal fills the mould and takes the same shape as the wax. The outer layer of clay is then chipped off and the metal icon is polished and finished as desired.

<h2>The name</h2>
<h3>Dhokra Damar tribes are the main traditional metalsmiths of West Bengal and Odisha. Their technique of lost wax casting is named after their tribe, hence Dhokra metal casting. The tribe extends from Jharkhand to West Bengal and Orissa; members are distant cousins of the Chhattisgarh Dhokras. A few hundred years ago, the Dhokras of Central and Eastern India traveled south as far as Kerala and north as far as Rajasthan and hence are now found all over India. Dhokra, or Dokra, craft from Dwariapur, West Bengal, is popular. Recently Adilabad Dokra from Telangana got Geographical Indicator tag in 2018.</h3><br>

<h2>What is Dhokra art?</h2>
<h3>Dhokra art is essentially stunning metal figurines fashioned from bronze and copper based alloys using a ‘lost wax casting’ known as ‘cire perdue’ in French. There are several processes involved in the making of Dhokra art and hence, a single piece could take up to a month or two to be created.<br></h3></p>


<br>
<h2>Decline of Dhokra art</h2>
<p><h3>It is unfortunate that this beautiful artwork is facing an obvious decline. The steady increase in the cost of raw material makes the end products way too expensive to attract enough buyers. As a result, artisans have been showing less interest in producing such master works. Lack of inspiration, encouragement and knowledge of new designs as well as the inability to adapt to modernization have also contributed to the decline of this artwork.
While there is still a heavy demand for these sculptures both commercially and in international markets, in cities like Milan, Paris and London, the primitive techniques and lack of access to modern technology causes a delay in production.<a href="https://www.craftsvilla.com/blog/dhokra-art-metal-casting-technique-from-west-bengal/">(Source)</a>

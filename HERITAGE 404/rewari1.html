In 2012, the first commercial run of a heavy steam engine by the railways took place after a gap of 16 years.

The engine for the run, too, was chosen after much deliberation. "It is a 1965-make WP class engine manufactured by Chittaranjan locomotives and decommissioned even before the Saharanpur loco shed shut down in 1987. A Pacific class model with a 4-6-2 wheel formation, it has 1,460 horsepower. It can touch 110kmph and was used to haul the fastest Express trains during its heyday," Vikas Arya, the then senior divisional mechanical engineer (power), Northern Railway had said.<a href=":- https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/infrastructure/rewari-locomotive-the-only-steam-loco-shed-that-remains-in-india/2012-first-commercial-run-after-16-years/slideshow/21137879.cms">(Source)</a>
